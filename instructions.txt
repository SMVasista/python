#1. To extract list of patient barcodes from the meta(data) directory
#Assuming demo/ is the current working directory
open meta/
open file_manifest.txt - this contains all the files which points to different datasets captured from different sources and centers
extract list of files from `File Name` column
access file from the location meta/Clinical/Biotab/`File Name`
open meta/Clinical/Biotab/`File Name`
create list of unique patient barcodes from colums `bcr_patient_uuid` and `bcr_sample_barcode` (This can be captured as a dict as we will reuse this information - can be stored in table)

#2 To extract mutation data for each patient barcode
#Assuming demo/ is the current working directory
open dnaseq/
for each barcode, extract all the rows present in the file "step4_gbm_liftover.aggregated.capture.tcga.uuid.maf2.4.migrated.somatic.maf" where $patientBarcode IN `Tumor_Sample_Barcode` (This can be a variable, look for `.maf` in filename) {Note that Tumor_Sample_Barcode will not be exactly equal to $patientBarcode}
	store  values from `Hugo_Symbol`	`Entrez_Gene_Id	`	`Chromosome`	`Start_position`	`End_position`	`Variant_Classification`	`Variant_Type`	`Reference_Allele`	`Tumor_Seq_Allele1`	`Tumor_Seq_Allele2`	`dbSNP_RS` where 'Tumor_Sample_Barcode` is barcode of patient in question
# Row5 of the file contains the actual column name
	[ SELECT `col1, col2, col3...` WHERE $patientBarcode in `Tumor_Sample_Barcode` ]
	(can be stored in separate table)

#3 To extract methylation data for each patient barcode
#Assuming demo/ is the current working directory
open dnamethylation27/ and dnamethylation450/
for each barcode, open file where file name has barcode in it (*$patientBarcode*.txt)
	store values from	`Beta_value`	`Gene_Symbol` `Chromosome` (This is a patient specific file so by default store every row in the file)
	(can be stored in separate table)
# Note : For patient barcode, information can exist in dnamethylation27/ or dnamethylation450/ or both or none

#4 To extract CNV data for each patient barcode
#Assuming demo/ is the current working directory
# 4a. To get hybridization file name
extract the tar gz cnv/broad.mit.edu_GBM.Genome_Wide_SNP_6.mage-tab.tar.gz and open file broad.mit.edu_GBM.Genome_Wide_SNP_6.sdrf.txt" INSIDE it
for each barcode, select the corresponding name in the `Hybridization Name` (from the above file - "broad.mit.edu_GBM.Genome_Wide_SNP_6.sdrf.txt") - this will be the file name for the patient
	[ SELECT  'Hybridization Name' WHERE  "$patientBarcode" in `Comment [TCGA Barcode]`  ]
#4b Extracting seg_mean values for each patient from the respective files
	The required files are, "`Hybridization Name`.hg19.seq.txt",  "`Hybridization Name`.noncnv_hg19.seq.txt"
	From each file, extract all rows  (This is a patient specific file so by default store every row in the file)
	store values from columns `Start`	`End`	`Segment_Mean`
	(can be stored in separate table)

So we can have three tables and a which has common elements $patientBarcode and $patientUUID (stored from step 1) which connects all the three tables
